# Dialogue Editor
Planned:
- There are several character files.
- Inside these character files are dialogues.
- Each dialogue has a unique ID.
- When the character files are loaded to the editor, the editor will track the ID.
- Inside each dialogue there are speeches.
- Inside the speeches are the character's name, and the character's text.
- After writing the characters here, the editor can export the character files as a JSON.
